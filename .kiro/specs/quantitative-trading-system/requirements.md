# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a quantitative trading system for the Indian stock market that combines Deep Q-Network (DQN) and LSTM models with sentiment analysis to make adaptive trading decisions. The system will fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance, process sentiment from news headlines, and execute a trend-following strategy with robust risk management to achieve superior returns compared to the NIFTY 50 benchmark.

6. WHEN data is collected THEN the system SHALL validate completeness and flag any missing data periods

### Requirement 2: Technical Indicator Calculation

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want technical indicators calculated from price data, so that I can identify market trends and patterns for trading decisions.

1. WHEN processing price data THEN the system SHALL calculate 14-day RSI for each stock
2. WHEN processing price data THEN the system SHALL calculate 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
3. WHEN processing price data THEN the system SHALL calculate 20-day Bollinger Bands (upper, middle, lower)
4. WHEN calculating indicators THEN the system SHALL handle insufficient data periods gracefully
5. WHEN indicators are calculated THEN the system SHALL store them alongside price data
6. IF indicator calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and exclude that stock from analysis

### Requirement 3: Sentiment Analysis Integration

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want sentiment analysis from news headlines, so that I can incorporate market sentiment into trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching stock data THEN the system SHALL retrieve news headlines from yfinance for each stock
2. WHEN processing headlines THEN the system SHALL use DistilBERT model to generate sentiment scores
3. WHEN calculating sentiment THEN the system SHALL produce scores between -1 (negative) and +1 (positive)
4. WHEN sentiment data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL assign neutral sentiment score of 0
5. WHEN storing sentiment THEN the system SHALL associate sentiment scores with corresponding trading dates
6. IF sentiment processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue with neutral sentiment assumption

### Requirement 4: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want clean and normalized data features, so that machine learning models can train effectively and make accurate predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning data THEN the system SHALL remove rows with missing OHLCV values
2. WHEN handling outliers THEN the system SHALL cap values beyond 3 standard deviations
3. WHEN normalizing features THEN the system SHALL apply min-max scaling to all numerical features
4. WHEN preparing training data THEN the system SHALL split data into 80% training (1995-2019) and 20% testing (2020-2025)
5. WHEN creating features THEN the system SHALL combine price data, technical indicators, and sentiment scores
6. IF preprocessing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and halt model training

### Requirement 5: LSTM Price Prediction Model

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want an LSTM model that predicts future price movements, so that I can anticipate market trends for trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building LSTM model THEN the system SHALL create 2 layers with 50 units each
2. WHEN configuring LSTM THEN the system SHALL apply 0.2 dropout rate to prevent overfitting
3. WHEN training LSTM THEN the system SHALL use sequential price data as input features
4. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL output next-day price movement probability
5. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL save the trained model for inference
6. IF LSTM training fails THEN the system SHALL log error details and retry with adjusted parameters

### Requirement 6: Deep Q-Network Trading Agent

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want a DQN agent that optimizes trading actions, so that I can maximize risk-adjusted returns through intelligent buy/sell/hold decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing DQN THEN the system SHALL define three actions: buy, sell, hold
2. WHEN calculating rewards THEN the system SHALL base rewards on Sharpe ratio improvement
3. WHEN training DQN THEN the system SHALL use LSTM predictions and sentiment scores as state inputs
4. WHEN making trading decisions THEN the system SHALL select actions that maximize expected reward
5. WHEN DQN training completes THEN the system SHALL save the trained agent for live trading
6. IF DQN training fails THEN the system SHALL log error and attempt training with different hyperparameters

### Requirement 7: Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want comprehensive risk management controls, so that I can protect capital and limit losses during adverse market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering positions THEN the system SHALL set stop-loss at 5% below entry price
2. WHEN sizing positions THEN the system SHALL limit each trade to 1-2% of total capital
3. WHEN managing portfolio THEN the system SHALL maintain positions in 20-30 different stocks
4. WHEN sentiment confidence is high THEN the system SHALL adjust position size by up to 20%
5. WHEN stop-loss is triggered THEN the system SHALL immediately close the position
6. IF portfolio concentration exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL reject new positions in overweight stocks

### Requirement 8: Backtesting Framework

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to backtest the trading strategy on historical data, so that I can evaluate performance before deploying real capital.

#### Acceptance Criteria
