# Quantitative Trading System Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to enhance the quantitative trading system by integrating the expanded dataset of 518 stocks and improving the model training and prediction processes.

## Current Status
- 24 LSTM models have been successfully trained
- Models have 7 features and a sequence length of 60 days
- Backtest results show mixed performance with some promising returns
- Current predictions have low confidence

## Enhancement Plan

### 1. Data Processing
- Process the expanded dataset of 518 stocks from the `data_518` folder
- Add comprehensive technical indicators to improve feature richness
- Ensure data quality and consistency across all stocks
- Create a robust data pipeline for future updates

**Implementation**: `process_new_data.py` script

### 2. Model Training Improvements
- Train models for all 518 stocks to expand coverage
- Enhance feature engineering to improve model accuracy
- Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters

**Implementation**: Enhanced `run_lstm_training.py` script

### 3. Portfolio Optimization
- Develop a portfolio allocation strategy based on model predictions
- Implement risk management rules to control drawdowns
- Create a diversification strategy across sectors and market caps
- Optimize position sizing based on prediction confidence

**Implementation**: New `portfolio_optimizer.py` module

### 4. Backtesting Framework
- Enhance the backtesting framework to evaluate strategies across multiple stocks
- Implement realistic transaction costs and slippage
- Add performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and maximum drawdown
- Compare performance against benchmark indices

**Implementation**: Enhanced `run_backtest_evaluation.py` script

### 5. Prediction Confidence Enhancement
- Develop ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models
- Implement confidence scoring based on market conditions
- Add market regime detection to adjust prediction thresholds
- Incorporate sentiment analysis for additional signal

**Implementation**: Enhanced `predict_stock_movement.py` script

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Data Processing** (Day 1)
   - Run `process_new_data.py` to process all 518 stocks
   - Validate data quality and completeness
   - Update system state to reflect new data

2. **Model Training** (Days 2-3)
   - Train LSTM models for all processed stocks
   - Evaluate model performance and adjust hyperparameters
   - Save trained models and metadata

3. **Backtesting** (Day 4)
   - Run comprehensive backtests on all trained models
   - Analyze performance metrics and identify best performers
   - Document findings and insights

4. **Portfolio Strategy** (Day 5)
   - Develop and implement portfolio allocation strategy
   - Test strategy with historical data
   - Optimize parameters for best risk-adjusted returns

5. **System Integration** (Day 6)
   - Integrate all components into a cohesive system
   - Create automated workflows for daily updates
   - Implement monitoring and alerting

## Success Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: Improve prediction accuracy to >55% across all stocks
- **Returns**: Achieve annualized returns >15% in backtests
- **Risk**: Maintain maximum drawdown <10%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Target Sharpe ratio >1.5
- **Coverage**: Successfully train models for >90% of the 518 stocks

## Next Steps
1. Run `run_process_new_data.bat` to process the expanded dataset
2. Run `run_lstm_direct.bat` to train models on the processed data
3. Evaluate model performance with `run_backtest_evaluation.py`
4. Make predictions with `predict_stock_movement.py`
5. Iterate and improve based on results
