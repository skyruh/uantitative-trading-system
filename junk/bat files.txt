Created setup_env.bat to set up a virtual environment and install dependencies
Created batch files for running the system in different modes:
run_setup.bat - Initialize and validate system configuration
run_collect.bat - Fetch historical market data
run_train.bat - Train LSTM and DQN models
run_backtest.bat - Run historical performance evaluation
run_complete.bat - Run the entire pipeline
run_status.bat - Display current system status
run_test_setup.bat - Run system setup verification
Created clean_global_packages.bat to uninstall packages from the global environment
Updated the README.md with instructions for using the virtual environment and batch files
To use this setup:

First, run clean_global_packages.bat to remove the packages from your global Python environment (be careful as this might affect other projects)
Run setup_env.bat to create a virtual environment and install all dependencies
Use the appropriate batch file to run the system in the desired mode
This approach isolates your project dependencies in a virtual environment, which helps prevent conflicts with other Python projects and ensures consistent behavior across different environments.
